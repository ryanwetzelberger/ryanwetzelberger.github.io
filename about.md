# Ryan Wetzelberger

I have about 14 years of experience in the technology industry as a whole.  I have worked positions in help desk, network engineering, devops engineering, and automation engineering.

What excites me:

* Finding ways to simplify complex systems
* Removing repetitive tasks from daily work
* Playing with new things (applications, languages, features, etc.)
* Creating happiness from my work

Some of my current work today includes:

* Defining standards for network configurations
* Automating networks with Python and Nornir
* Building pipelines to streamline deployment of applications
* Using Ansible for deployment of system configurations
