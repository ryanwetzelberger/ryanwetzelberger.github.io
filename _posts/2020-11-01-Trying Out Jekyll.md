title: Trying out Jekyll
---
This is my first post using Jekyll!

I started doing research on static website creation because I think that WordPress is heavy for a simple blog site.  I haven't felt any need to have people comment against my posts.   If someone wants to reach me, I link a few contact options.  The added benefit to move away from WordPress is getting less spam comments!

Jekyll was the first static website creator I looked into.  I decided to learn Jekyll because I stumbled across [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  Github Pages is free, making it an easy decision to play with GitHub Pages.  I found that it utilizes a git repository with Jekyll.  Also, Jekyll is built on Ruby, which I am familiar with.  Bottom line, it seemed like a really good match for me.

Running through the [Getting Started Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), I found that it has great flexibility with adding pages, and templating, making it easier to build a quick site for documentation.  If I need something complex, I can write a quick Ruby script.  Also, I can use markdown and html files.  This provides me with great flexibility for how I want display my information.

The final thing that I love about static website creation was how easy it is to integrate it with git, which I use everyday at work.  This provides great control over my site through easy revision history.

I want to spend time in the future to explore [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) because I work with Python regularly.  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) also interested me, since Go interests me.
