title: Setting up Microk8s on Raspberry Pi
---

I made 1 big goal for my lab.  I wanted to keep the power consumption low.  I could translate that into being more cloud forward, but I wanted to mess around with Raspberry Pi's.  

My next goal is to become more proficient with administering a k8s cluster.  So I started searching for recommendations and guides to install k8s on a set of Raspberry Pi's.  (Microk8s)[https://microk8s.io] kept rising to the top of the list with many installation guides to use. I stuck with (Canonical's Guide)[https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-kubernetes-cluster-on-raspberry-pi#1-overview], since they made Microk8s and Canonical has a decent track record with making and maintaining Ubuntu.
